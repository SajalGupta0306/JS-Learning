// momoization: caching the values for the already executed piece of code to avoid unnecessary processing time

// Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and
// returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again

// eg: recursive function calls
// eg: fetch api call for same resource again and again
// calling the method with same set of input again and again

// Eg: 1
// square of a number

// Fibonacci Sequence
// Factorial
