pseudo classes
a pseudo-class is basically a phantom state or specific characteristic of an element that can be targeted with CSS. 
A few common pseudo-classes are :link, :visited, :hover, :active, :first-child and :nth-child


pseudo elements
pseudo-elements are like virtual elements that we can treat as regular HTML elements. 
The thing is that they don’t exist in the document tree or DOM. 
This means we don’t actually type the pseudo-elements, but rather create them with CSS.
A few common pseudo-elements are ::after, ::before and ::first-letter

> style a specific part of the element.
