  o static - Default property. Elements are not affected by the TBLR properties.
  o relative - Positioned relative to its normal position. Elements are adjusted by the TBLR properties.
  o absolute - Positioned relative to the nearest positioned (position with value = relative) ancestor. 
               If it has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
  o fixed - Positioned relative to the viewport, it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
