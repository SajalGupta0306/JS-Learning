1. horizontal and vertical scaling
2. load balancing
3. caching
4. cache invalidation
5. CDN
5. ACID





step 1 : discuss on the functional and non - functional requirements 
step 2: discuss the use-case by assuming the number of users and how many times application will be accessed 
step 3: discuss on how the UI would look like
step 4: discuss on the apis required to communicate between the FE and BE
step 5: discuss on the db models which might be needed and link with DB (SQL or NOSQL) / Object Store - blob storage like S3 (Storing Images)
step 6: design a HLD
step 7: scale the HLD by adding load balancer,  doing horizontal scaling or adding caching and CDN
